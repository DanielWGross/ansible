1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
    - I *think* this is the default for Mac but should confirm and update if necessary
2. Ensure Python 3 is in your `$PATH`
    - NOTE: Need to update with more specifics here.
3. Upgrade `pip`: 
    ```
    sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
    ```
4. Install Ansible
    ```
    pip3 install ansible
    ```
